SmartConnector Features:
----------------------------
Smart Connectors can both receive and retrieve information from network devices. 
If the device sends information, the connector becomes a receiver. 
But, if the device does not send information, the connector can retrieve it.

The connectors support the following data collection and event reporting formats:

Log File Readers (including text and log file)
Syslog
SNMP
Database
XML
Proprietary protocols, such as OPSEC

Data Encryption
------------------
For optimum performance, the number of encrypted fields must be limited to 20.

Event Aggregation
---------------------
For example, if the connector is configured to aggregate events with a certain Source IP and Port, Destination IP and Port, 
and Device Action whenever the events occur 10 times in 30 seconds. If 10 events with these matching values are received by 
the connector within that time frame, they are grouped into a single event with an aggregated event count of 10.

If the 30-seconds time frame expires and the connector receives only two matching events, the connector creates a single aggregated
event with an aggregated event count of two. If 900 matching events are generated during 30 seconds, the connector creates 90 aggregated 
events, each with an aggregated event count of 10.
Firewalls are a good candidate for aggregation because of the volume of events with similar data coming in from multiple devices.

FIPS Compliance - Federal Information Processing Standards
------------------------------------------------------------
When FIPS-compliant connectors connect to a non-FIPS-compliant destination, the solution is not considered FIPS compliant. 
Also, when the destination is installed in FIPS Suite B compliant mode, the SmartConnectors also must be installed in FIPS Suite B compliant mode.


FIPS Compliant Connectors
-------------------------------
The following connectors are FIPS compliant:
All syslog connectors
All file reader connectors
All SNMP connectors
Most database connectors (except Oracle Audit DB and when using SQL Server drivers with encryption)
Cisco Secure IPS SDEE connectors
Sourcefire Defense Center eStreamer connector
Check Point OPSEC NG connector


FIPS Non-Compliant SmartConnector
---------------------------------------
The following SmartConnector are not FIPS compliant:
Database connectors using SQL Server drivers with encryption
Connectors using Oracle drivers
Connectors running on AIX or Micro Focus UX platforms only










































The connectors support the following data collection and event reporting formats:
l
Log File Readers (including text and log file)
l
Syslog
l
SNMP
l
Database
l
XML
l
Proprietary protocols, such as OPSEC
The ArcSight ESM Console, ESM Manager, and connectors communicate using HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL also referred to as HTTPS).
